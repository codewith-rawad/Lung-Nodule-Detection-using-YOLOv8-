## üóÇÔ∏è Dataset Overview

The model is trained on a well-curated dataset of **chest X-ray images** specifically labeled for lung nodule detection and classification. The dataset contains:

- **High-quality frontal chest X-rays** from diverse patients  
- **Detailed annotations** with bounding boxes around lung nodules  
- Nodules labeled as **benign** or **malignant** to enable classification  
- Data split into **training**, **validation**, and **test** subsets to ensure robust evaluation  
- Augmentation techniques applied during training to simulate real-world variations, including rotation, scaling, color adjustments, and mosaic/mixup augmentations  

This comprehensive dataset ensures the model learns to accurately detect lung nodules across various conditions and image qualities, making it highly effective for clinical support.
